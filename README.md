# SolarTracker
I designed and created this project to better understand the complexity of tracking 
the sun and to calculate the difference between a static solar panel and one that tracks the sun.
Also included are the costs of materials at the time of construction.

This project first came to mind to see if I could do it but also to see if I can reduce our energy 
consumption as we live in Phoenix, AZ. Our summers are very hot and our electric bills can over $500 
a month sometimes. 

Step 1: Research - Did some research to first see if there would be a benefit and if so how much. It seemed as 
if the only thing I have found was the same calculations but no experimental data. The average of the 
calculations that I found estimated an increase of about 30% in energy acquisition.

Step 2: Prototype design- So know that I have some numbers to work with I can now see if I can even program something to 
track the sun. I started off designing a mini platform in solidworks to hold one solar cell, two 9g servos, and four 
photoresistors (two for the longitude axis and two from latitude axis). The photoresistors are used quantify 
the amount of light that is shining on it and compare with the others. After designing and printing it I 
attempted to start coding.

Step 3: Prototype build - After putting things together and testing out numerous iterations of code I found something 
that worked. To test its functionality I put it in a dark room and shined a light at the solar cell and moved it around. 
After passing all tests that I created, I determined that I could start on another prototype that is much larger to collect 
experimental data from. 

Step 4: 2nd Prototype design - Since this would be much larger I had to rethink how I was going to design it. This proved 
to be a littel challenging because I was limited to only a small 3d printer. Determining stress' and strains are actually not 
that easy with 3d printed parts unless I apply large factors of safety. Considering this was still a prototype and I really 
only needed experimental data it didnt need to look pretty--only function properly.
